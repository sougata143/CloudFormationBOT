# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline CloudFormation Stack

## Overview
Provisions infrastructure for a Jenkins-based Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Parameters
- `Environment`: Deployment environment (dev/staging/prod)
- `EnvironmentName`: Prefix for resource names

## Resources Created
- Jenkins EC2 Instance
- Security Groups
- IAM Roles and Policies
- Elastic IP
- EBS Volume for Jenkins Home Directory

## Purpose
Establish a robust, scalable, and secure Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for microservices.

## Resources Created
- **Jenkins EC2 Instance**
  - Purpose: Host Jenkins automation server
  - Configuration:
    - Latest LTS version
    - Optimized instance type
    - Enhanced networking

- **Security Groups**
  - Purpose: Control network access
  - Inbound Rules:
    - SSH from management network
    - Jenkins web interface
  - Outbound Rules:
    - GitHub/GitLab access
    - ECR/Docker registry
    - Deployment targets

- **IAM Roles and Policies**
  - Purpose: Secure and controlled access
  - Permissions:
    - ECR push/pull
    - S3 artifact storage
    - CloudFormation deployment
    - Lambda function updates

## Deployment Workflow
1. Code Commit
2. Automated Testing
3. Build Docker Images
4. Push to ECR
5. Deploy to ECS/Fargate
6. Run Integration Tests
7. Rollback/Promote

## Security Recommendations
- Use Jenkins credentials vault
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Regular security plugin updates
- Network isolation

## Deployment Considerations
- Ensure correct VPC and subnet configurations
- Configure security group ingress/egress rules
- Set up appropriate IAM permissions

## Security Recommendations
- Use latest Jenkins LTS version
- Enable security plugins
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Regularly update and patch Jenkins
