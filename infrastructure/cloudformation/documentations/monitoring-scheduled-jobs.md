# Monitoring Scheduled Jobs Infrastructure Documentation

## Purpose
Design a robust, automated job scheduling and execution framework for infrastructure maintenance, monitoring, and optimization tasks.

## Resources Created
- **EventBridge Scheduler**
  - Purpose: Centralized job scheduling
  - Capabilities:
    - Cron-based scheduling
    - Rate-based triggers
    - One-time and recurring jobs

- **Lambda Execution Targets**
  - Purpose: Serverless job execution
  - Job Categories:
    - Cleanup operations
    - Compliance checks
    - Backup verification
    - Resource optimization

- **SNS Notification Channels**
  - Purpose: Job status communication
  - Notification Types:
    - Success alerts
    - Failure notifications
    - Performance summaries

## Scheduled Job Categories
1. Infrastructure Maintenance
   - Unused resource cleanup
   - Snapshot management
   - Disk space optimization

2. Security Compliance
   - Access key rotation
   - Security group audit
   - Vulnerability scanning

3. Cost Management
   - Unused resource identification
   - Reserved instance optimization
   - Spending trend analysis

## Execution Strategies
- Idempotent job design
- Minimal resource consumption
- Comprehensive error handling
- Retry mechanisms
- Detailed logging

## Monitoring and Observability
- CloudWatch metrics tracking
- X-Ray distributed tracing
- Comprehensive logging
- Performance profiling

## Security Considerations
- Least privilege execution roles
- Encrypted job parameters
- Secure parameter storage
- Network isolation

## Best Practices
- Modular job design
- Stateless function implementation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Regular job validation
