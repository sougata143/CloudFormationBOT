# Route53 DNS Routing CloudFormation Stack

## Overview
Configures DNS routing and health check mechanisms using Amazon Route53.

## Parameters
- `Environment`: Deployment environment (dev/staging/prod)
- `EnvironmentName`: Prefix for resource names

## Resources Created
- Hosted Zones
- DNS Records
- Health Checks
- Routing Policies

## Purpose
Implement advanced DNS routing and management for microservices architecture.

## Resources Created
- **Hosted Zones**
  - Purpose: Manage domain name resolution
  - Configurations:
    - Private/Public zones
    - Multi-environment support

- **DNS Records**
  - Types:
    - A Records
    - CNAME Records
    - Alias Records
  - Use Cases:
    - Service discovery
    - Load balancing
    - Blue/Green deployments

- **Health Checks**
  - Purpose: Ensure service availability
  - Monitoring:
    - HTTP/HTTPS endpoints
    - TCP connections
    - Interval-based checks

## Routing Strategies
1. Weighted Routing
   - Gradual traffic migration
   - Canary deployments

2. Failover Routing
   - Primary/Secondary configurations
   - Automatic disaster recovery

3. Geolocation Routing
   - Region-based traffic distribution
   - Latency optimization

## Compliance and Monitoring
- DNSSEC support
- Query logging
- Performance tracking

## Key Features
- Multi-environment DNS management
- Health-based routing
- Failover configurations
- Geographic routing support

## Best Practices
- Use alias records for better performance
- Implement health checks
- Configure appropriate TTL values
- Use weighted routing for blue/green deployments
